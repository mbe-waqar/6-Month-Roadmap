## ⚠️ START HERE: CHECK PREREQUISITES

**This is an ADVANCED program. You MUST have solid foundations before starting.**

### **Step 1: Read Prerequisites**
**Open:** [PREREQUISITES.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/PREREQUISITES.md)

**Required Skills:**
- ✅ **Python:** Classes, OOP, NumPy, Pandas
- ✅ **Math:** Linear algebra, calculus basics, probability
- ✅ **ML Fundamentals:** Can train neural networks, understand backpropagation
- ✅ **Deep Learning:** Basic CNN knowledge, PyTorch/TensorFlow experience
- ✅ **Tools:** Git, command line, Jupyter notebooks

### **Step 2: Self-Assessment**
Complete all self-check questions in PREREQUISITES.md

**Can answer YES to all:**
- Have you trained at least 2-3 ML models before?
- Can you implement a neural network in PyTorch?
- Do you understand overfitting and regularization?
- Can you write Python classes confidently?
- Are you comfortable with Git and command line?

### **Step 3: Decide Your Path**

**If prerequisites are SOLID:** 
→ Use Week 0 for quick review and environment setup (Dec 1-7)  
→ Start main program Week 1 on December 8

**If prerequisites are WEAK:**
→ Follow prerequisite learning resources (2-4 weeks)  
→ Then do Week 0 revision  
→ Start main program when ready

**Don't skip prerequisites - they're critical for success!**
